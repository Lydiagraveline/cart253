# Reflection

I started this semester knowing nothing about coding, so when I looked through the schedule for this course back in September it was hard to imagine that I'd be able to create any sort of impressive program. Here I am 3 months later
making an entire project! This was hands down the best online course i've taken. I've never learned a skill as quickly as I have this semester--the weekly exercises were a perfectly rewarding way to practice the new content which left me feeling accomplished.

I didn't realize I would enjoy the problem solving aspect of programming so much (i now realize that problem solving is 99% of what programming is haha). I work a lot with oil paint and I always say that starting a new painting is just making a bunch of mistakes and then trying to fix them, a lot like how my programs go. I find that my love for painting is very compatible with compatible with programming, so I'm excited to see where my new skill takes me!

I think the most significant challenge for me has been knowing how to approach certain problems with the knowledge I have at the given time, but I think that goes for anybody who's just beginning to learn anything. Specifically I've had the most trouble understanding when to use arrays and multiple polymorphic classes. But having access to past and future course content has significantly helped me overcome these issues!

I am probably most proud of my first project, Pearl Diver. It was the first time I tried object oriented programming and I loved implementing my own art into the game. In the future I can see myself really indulging in that aspect, using my art to create some kind of atmosphere sounds super fun! I am also excited about my current project, i've been tackling issues that are super challenging and rewarding.

In the future I want to continue going down this creative coding route. In a different course this semester I learned some html + css + vanilla javascript, but the p5.js library has been by far my favorite way to program and play around. 

Thank you so much for this class, i'm so excited for more!
